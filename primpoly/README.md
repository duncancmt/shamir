The primitive polynomials used in this program are the smallest such primitive 
polynomials of the given order over GF(2). They were generated using Primpoly by 
Sean Erik O'Connor, Version 16.1. Primpoly's unmodified source is found in 
primpoly.tar.gz. Primpoly is licensed under the GNU General Public License 
version 3 or later. The terms of this license are provided as gpl-3.0.txt. The 
modification required to generate the smallest 5-term primitive polynomial (no 
3-term polynomials exist of the supported orders) is provided as primpoly.patch.
